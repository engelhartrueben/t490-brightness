*A Rust built, simple controller for your T490 brightness*

> [!WARNING]
> T490-Brightness is still very much in its early stages. There are no stable releases at the moment.

## About
**T490-Brightness** is designed with a explicit distinction between policy and mechanism. This **program** is a mechanism, and the command line arguments the user passes are the **policy**. 

## Current todo items 
- Change name to something else. This project is very much turning into a general brightness controller.
- Add basic increase and decrease support for brightness. An early, but local, version of this program worked, but right now, its a bit busted at the moment.
